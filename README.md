`"Often we do not recall when we struggled"`

### Hewoo~ I'm Brandon but I also go by Bee/Pengy/Love  

🐝 I am going into my senior year of my bachelors in Computer Engineering and love programming in C~

🐝 I am always down to learn something new so feel free to educate me on things I could be doing better~
