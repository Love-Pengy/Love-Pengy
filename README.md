### Hello! I'm Brandon but I also go by Bee/Pengy/Love  

I am going into my senior year of my bachelors in Computer Engineering and love programming in C~

I currently have a youtube channel where I post myself programming everyday until I graduate: [Youtube](https://youtube.com/@lovelytransposition?si=PNmCZkqGIJJX4uEc). If you know me from there hellooo <3~

I am always down to learn something new so feel free to educate me on things I could be doing better~
